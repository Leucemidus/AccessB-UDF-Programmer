# AccessB-UDF-Programmer

The exe file is in the AccessB UDF Programmer/bin/Debug folder

Manual soon!!!


UPDATE: The UDF feature is no longer avaliable, instead I used the memory program to implement the USB2USART mode, so you can use the AccessB on two modes: AccessB mode and USB2USART mode, the first is the regular operatinal mode where you can use the C# class files to take use of all the peripherals of the PIC and the USB2UART mode where the board act as a simple USB to USART converter, listing as a COM port and taking advantage of the voltage level converting circuity on the board that is implemented over USAR, I2C and SPI capable pin's of the PIC, also a extra pin that can be used as CS/SS.
